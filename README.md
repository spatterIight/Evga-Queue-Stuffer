# Evga-Queue-Stuffer

Stuff's the EVGA GPU Queue with random values by use of Pupputeer Stealth and 2Captcha -- a ReCaptcha solving service. Made for use with a catchall such that email addresses can appear unique while all going to the same inbox. 

Eventually your queue spot will reach the front and the email addresses will be sent a unique purchasing link for the GPU
